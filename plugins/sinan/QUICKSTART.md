# Quickstart

From `git clone` to your first working `/do` command.

## TL;DR

Easiest path: open your target project in your agent and paste the install prompt from [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

Manual path:

1. Clone Sinan once:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SethGammon/sinan.git ~/sinan
   ```

2. From the project you want Sinan to manage, run the matching installer:

   ```bash
   node ~/sinan/scripts/install.js --runtime codex --add-marketplace
   ```

   ```bash
   node ~/sinan/scripts/install.js --runtime claude --install --scope local
   ```

3. Start a fresh Codex or Claude Code thread, enable **Sinan** if the runtime asks, then run:

   ```text
   /do setup --express
   /do next
   /do review src/main.ts
   ```

Both runtimes converge on the same harness commands once the runtime-specific install step is done. `/do next` is the fastest check that Sinan sees the project state and can explain the next action, approval boundary, and verification profile.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** or **OpenAI Codex** -- the runtime Sinan extends
- **[Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/)** -- required for hooks and scripts

Authentication depends on the runtime you use. Sinan layers on top of the runtime you already have configured.

## 1. Clone Sinan

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SethGammon/sinan.git ~/sinan
```

That's it. No build step, no `npm install`. Sinan runs directly on Node.js.

## 2. Choose Your Runtime Path

### Claude Code

From your target project root, run the bootstrap installer:

```bash
node ~/sinan/scripts/claude-install.js --install --scope local
claude
```

This validates the Claude marketplace, adds Sinan from the local clone,
installs **Sinan** into local scope, and writes resolved hook paths to
the target project. Local scope is gitignored and affects only you in this repo.

Alternative manual install from inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add ~/sinan
/plugin install sinan@sinan-local --scope local
```

For a one-session trial without registering the marketplace:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ~/sinan
```

For the full Claude-specific flow, see [docs/CLAUDE_INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md](docs/CLAUDE_INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md).

### Codex

From your target project root, run the bootstrap installer:

```bash
node ~/sinan/scripts/codex-install.js --add-marketplace
codex
```

This single command refreshes Sinan's Codex plugin package, writes the local
plugin marketplace entry, generates the target project's Codex fallback
artifacts, runs the readiness verifier, and on Windows checks the Codex shell
and sandbox settings. It creates Codex-facing files such as `AGENTS.md`,
`.codex/config.toml`, `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, plugin-bundled
`hooks/hooks.json`, projected agents, projected skills, and Sinan MCP wiring.

The `--add-marketplace` flag also runs Codex CLI marketplace registration when
the CLI is installed. Omit it when you only want to prepare files and follow the
printed Codex app steps.

Then install or enable Sinan from Codex:

- App: open **Plugins**, choose **Sinan Local Plugins**, select **Add to Codex** for **Sinan**, then start a new thread.
- CLI: run `/plugins`, install or enable **Sinan**, then start a new thread.

`scripts/install-hooks-codex.js` remains available for legacy per-project
`.codex/hooks.json` installs, but plugin-bundled hooks are the preferred Codex
path.

For the full Codex-specific flow, see [docs/CODEX_INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md](docs/CODEX_INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md).

## 3. Run setup

Open your project in Claude Code or Codex and run:

```
/do setup
```

### Choose your mode

Setup opens with a mode selection — pick based on how much time you have:

```
  [1] Recommended  — auto-detect your stack, install hooks, live demo  (~3 min)
  [2] Full Tour    — everything in Recommended + guided skill walkthrough (~8 min)
  [3] Express      — zero questions, auto-detect, hooks installed, done  (~30 sec)
```

**Recommended** is the default. It walks you through stack confirmation, runs a
live demo on your actual code, and ends with a reference card showing every
command and what's now protecting your session.

**Full Tour** adds a guided walkthrough of all five skill families after the demo.
Good for your first time or when onboarding a teammate.

**Express** skips every question. Detects your stack, installs hooks, registers
skills, and exits in under 30 seconds. Good for quick starts on familiar stacks.

You can also run `/do setup --express` to skip mode selection entirely.

### What setup does

In all modes, setup:

1. **Installs or refreshes runtime hooks first** -- before any questions. On Claude Code
   this writes resolved absolute hook paths into `.claude/settings.json`. On Codex,
   the runtime-specific compatibility files and translated hooks are expected to already
   exist and setup continues from there.

2. **Detects your stack** -- language, framework, package manager, test framework.
   Reads `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, lock files. No questions if detection succeeds.

3. **Generates runtime project config** -- for example `.claude/harness.json` in the
   Claude path, along with the project-level Sinan state used by the harness.

4. **Scaffolds `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`** -- creates them if missing, appends a
   Sinan section if they exist. Never overwrites existing content.

5. **Optional integrations** -- GitHub triage workflow + MCP server config, if you want them.

6. **Runs a live demo** -- on a recently changed file in your repo (Recommended + Full Tour).

> **Why does the runtime-specific install still matter?**
> Claude Code and Codex load Sinan differently. Claude relies on the plugin path
> and hook installation into `.claude/settings.json`. Codex can load Sinan as
> a plugin with bundled skills/hooks/MCP and can also use generated project
> artifacts like `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/config.toml`, and projected agents.
> After moving Sinan to a new location, refresh the runtime-specific install step
> and then re-run `/do setup`.

### Try a command after setup

```
/do review src/main.ts              # 5-pass code review
/do generate tests for utils        # Tests that actually run
/do why is the login slow           # Root cause analysis
/do refactor the auth module        # Safe multi-file refactoring
```

Or describe what you want in plain English -- the `/do` router picks the right tool:

```
/do fix the login bug
/do what's wrong with the API
/do build a caching layer
```

## 4. Scale up when ready

```
/marshal audit the codebase         # Multi-step, single session
/archon build the payment system    # Multi-session campaign
/fleet overhaul all three services  # Parallel agents, shared discovery
/improve sinan --n=5              # Autonomous quality loops
```

Or let `/do` escalate automatically -- it routes to orchestrators when the task requires it.

Create custom skills to capture patterns you keep repeating:
```
/create-skill
```

## Troubleshooting

**Hook not firing / "command not found" errors:**
Re-run the runtime-specific install step, then re-run `/do setup`. For Claude Code,
that usually means re-running `claude-install.js --install --scope local`. For Codex,
that usually means re-running `codex-install.js --add-marketplace`.

Alternatively, run directly from your project directory:
```bash
node /path/to/sinan/scripts/install-hooks.js
```

For Codex:
```bash
node /path/to/sinan/scripts/codex-install.js --add-marketplace
```

For Claude Code:
```bash
node /path/to/sinan/scripts/claude-install.js --install --scope local
```

**"[protect-files] Blocked" message:**
Sinan prevented an edit to a protected file. The message names the specific file and
the pattern that triggered the block. To allow the edit, remove the pattern from
`protectedFiles` in `.claude/harness.json`.

**"[Circuit Breaker] tool has failed N times" message:**
A tool failed repeatedly. This is Sinan suggesting you try a different approach, not
an error in Sinan itself. The message names the specific tool and shows the last error.
Read the suggestions and switch strategy.

**Campaign file in broken state:**
If a campaign file in `.planning/campaigns/` has corrupted YAML frontmatter or invalid
status, delete the file and restart the campaign. Campaign logs in `.planning/improvement-logs/`
and `.planning/telemetry/` are preserved independently.

**"/do setup" fails or produces empty harness.json:**
Ensure you are running from your project root (not the Sinan plugin directory).
Setup needs to detect your project's language and framework from files like
`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, or `Cargo.toml`.

**Daemon won't start / "No active campaign" error:**
The daemon attaches to an active campaign. Check `.planning/campaigns/` for a file
with `Status: active`. If none exists, start work first with `/improve`, `/archon`,
or `/fleet`, then attach the daemon.

**Daemon is paused (level-up-pending):**
An improve loop hit distribution saturation and needs human approval for the next
quality level. Review the proposals at `.planning/rubrics/{target}-proposals.md`,
edit the rubric with approved changes, and set the campaign status back to `active`.
The daemon's watchdog will detect the change and resume automatically.

## What the plugin scaffolds per-project

On first session start, the `init-project` hook creates:

```
your-project/
  .planning/              # Campaign state, fleet sessions, intake, telemetry
    _templates/           # Campaign and fleet templates (copied from plugin)
    campaigns/            # Active + completed campaigns
    fleet/                # Fleet session state + discovery briefs
    coordination/         # Multi-instance scope claims
    intake/               # Work items pending processing
    telemetry/            # Agent run + hook timing logs (JSONL, stays local)
  .citadel/
    scripts/              # Utility scripts synced from plugin each session
    plugin-root.txt       # Pointer to plugin install location
  .claude/
    harness.json          # Project config (generated by /do setup)
    agent-context/        # Rules injected into sub-agents
```

## Telemetry

The harness logs agent events, hook timing, and discovery compression to
`.planning/telemetry/` in JSONL format. Logs never leave your machine.

## Relationship to Superpowers

[Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) teaches good methodology --
brainstorm before coding, write tests first, review before shipping. Sinan gives
it the infrastructure to execute that methodology at scale: campaign persistence,
fleet coordination, lifecycle hooks, and telemetry. They are complementary.
