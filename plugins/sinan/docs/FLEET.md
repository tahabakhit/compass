# Fleet — Parallel Campaign Orchestration

> last-updated: 2026-05-07

Fleet runs multiple campaigns simultaneously through coordinated waves,
sharing discoveries between them.

## When to Use Fleet

- Work decomposes into 3+ independent streams
- Domains don't overlap in files (e.g., API + frontend + docs)
- You want institutional-scale throughput from a single session

## Wave Mechanics

```
Wave 1: 2-3 agents run in parallel (worktree-isolated)
  │
  ← Collect results from all agents
  ← Compress each output to ~500-token discovery brief
  ← Merge branches into main
  │
Wave 2: 2-3 agents, informed by Wave 1 discoveries
  │
  ← Collect, compress, merge
  │
Wave N: Continue until work queue empty
```

### Discovery Relay

The key innovation. After each wave:

1. Each agent's output is compressed to a ~500-token brief
2. Briefs capture: what was built, decisions made, discoveries, failures
3. Next wave's agents receive ALL previous briefs in their context
4. Agents don't rediscover what previous agents already found

Example: Wave 1 Agent A finds the API has rate limiting at 100 req/min.
Wave 2 Agent C (building the frontend) starts with that knowledge and
implements client-side throttling without hitting the limit first.

### Worktree Isolation

A [git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) is a separate working directory
linked to the same repository. Think of it as a lightweight clone — it shares the same
`.git` history but has its own files and branch. This lets multiple agents edit files
simultaneously without conflicts.

Every agent runs in its own git worktree:
- Separate working directory — no file conflicts between agents
- Independent git branch — clean merge path
- Dependencies auto-installed by the WorktreeCreate hook
- Environment files copied from main repo

## Fleet Session Files

State lives in `.planning/fleet/session-{slug}.md`:

```markdown
# Fleet Session: {name}

Status: active
Direction: {what was requested}

## Work Queue
| # | Campaign | Scope | Deps | Status | Wave | Agent | Branch | Evidence |
|---|----------|-------|------|--------|------|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | API auth | src/api/ | none | merged | 1 | build | codex/api-auth | validator pass |
| 2 | Frontend | src/ui/ | none | validated | 1 | build | codex/frontend | validator pass |
| 3 | Integration | both | 1, 2 | pending | 2 | verify | - | - |

## Wave 1 Results
### Agent: api-builder
**Built:** JWT auth middleware
**Discoveries:** Uses jose library, tokens expire in 15min

## Shared Context
- API uses jose for JWT (inform frontend agents)
- 15min token expiry means frontend needs refresh logic
```

Sinan also ships a queue steward:

```bash
node scripts/fleet-steward.js --session .planning/fleet/session-{slug}.md
```

The steward parses the markdown table as the session DAG. It reports runnable
tasks, dependency-blocked tasks, merge-order blockers, and same-wave scope
conflicts. It is read-only unless `--write` is paired with `--mark-failed`, which
marks the failed row and adds a repair task.

Fleet also reads `.planning/verification/worktree-readiness/*.json`. A task whose
branch matches a `blockFleet: true` readiness report is shown under
`READINESS BLOCKED` instead of `READY TO RUN`. Use
`--override-readiness` only when a human has verified the worktree manually.

## Shared State Merge Strategies

Parallel agents access shared `.planning/` state. Each resource has a declared merge strategy to prevent silent overwrites:

| Resource | File | Strategy |
|----------|------|----------|
| Discoveries | `fleet/{session}/discoveries.jsonl` | Append-only — each agent appends, never overwrites |
| Agent briefs | `fleet/{session}/briefs/{agent}.md` | Per-agent file — no conflicts possible |
| Session file | `fleet/{session}-session.md` | Lock-on-write — agent acquires `.lock` before editing, releases after |
| Campaign file | `campaigns/{name}.md` | Lock-on-write — same lock protocol |
| Telemetry | `telemetry/agent-runs.jsonl` | Append-only — atomic append per event |
| Wiki staging | `wiki/staging/` | Per-agent file — named by agent ID |
| Coordination claims | `coordination/claims/` | Per-scope file — one file per claimed directory |

An agent that violates its resource's strategy may silently corrupt shared state.
When in doubt, use append-only and let Fleet merge after the wave completes.

## Consistency Voting

For high-stakes Fleet decisions, spawn 3 Phase Validators and require 2/3 agreement:

**When to vote:**
- A wave completes partially (some agents succeeded, some failed) and the next wave's scope depends on the outcome
- A failed validation merge would affect other agents' branches
- An abort decision would discard multiple agents' work

**How to vote:**
1. Spawn 3 Phase Validator agents with identical context
2. Each agent independently examines the evidence and returns a verdict (`proceed` / `abort` / `retry`)
3. Tally: majority verdict wins; timeout counts as `proceed` (never blocks indefinitely)
4. Log the vote and outcome to `telemetry/agent-runs.jsonl`

## Coordination

### Scope Overlap Prevention

Agents in the same wave MUST NOT touch the same files:
- Parent/child directories overlap: `src/api/` and `src/api/auth/` conflict
- Sibling directories are safe: `src/api/` and `src/ui/` don't conflict
- `(read-only)` scopes never conflict

### Multi-Instance Coordination

If multiple Archon or Fleet instances run simultaneously:
- `.sinan/scripts/coordination.js` manages instance registration and scope claims
- Claims are file-based (no database needed)
- Dead instances cleaned up by `npm run coord:sweep`

## Budget

- ~700K tokens per wave for agent outputs
- ~300K tokens reserved for Fleet's own orchestration
- Start with 2 agents per wave, scale up as you trust scope separation
- If context runs low: stop spawning waves, write continuation state

## Commands

```
/fleet [direction]     Decompose and execute in parallel
/fleet [spec-path]     Read a spec file, decompose, execute
/fleet continue        Resume from session file
/fleet                 Health diagnostic → auto-select work
```
