# Operating Loop Proof

Sinan is easiest to evaluate by watching one complete operating loop in a
real repository. The proof is not that an agent can describe features. The proof
is that a later session can inspect what happened and continue from evidence.

Use this checklist when recording a demo, reviewing a PR, or deciding whether a
new workflow belongs in Sinan.

Run the local proof preflight with:

```bash
node scripts/operating-proof.js --write
```

Use `--run-verification` when you want the proof to execute the selected
verification command instead of only reporting it.

For a stricter first-use assessment, run:

```bash
node scripts/usefulness-trial.js --write --run-verification
```

That writes `.planning/usefulness-trial/latest.md` and returns a decision such
as `ready-for-dogfood`, `setup-needed`, `incomplete-evidence`, or `blocked`.
See [Usefulness Trial](USEFULNESS_TRIAL.md).

## The Loop

| Step | Command or surface | Evidence to inspect | What it proves |
|---|---|---|---|
| Install | installer plus `/do setup --express` | `.planning/`, runtime config, hook setup output | Sinan can attach to the current repository without placeholder paths. |
| Orient | `/do next` or dashboard scripts | current state, next action, risk boundary, verification profile | The operator can see what Sinan thinks before approving work. |
| Route | `/do <plain-English task>` | selected skill or orchestrator, handoff, changed files if any | Users do not need to memorize every skill before getting useful behavior. |
| Verify | project-specific check selected by the agent | command output, verification plan, pass/fail summary | Work is tied to the repository's real quality gate, not a generic claim. |
| Report | final answer, PR body, or `.planning/` report | summary, decisions, unresolved items, follow-up command | Another session can resume from a concrete record. |

## Good Evidence

Good proof is boring and inspectable:

- the repository is real, not a synthetic fixture built only for the demo
- commands are shown exactly as typed
- setup uses the current project root
- verification is chosen from the project, not guessed from Sinan docs
- generated reports identify files, commands, and outcomes
- unsupported runtime features are reported as unavailable instead of hidden

Weak proof looks like a feature tour:

- screenshots without commands
- claims about routing without showing the selected workflow
- reports that omit the verification command
- demos that rely on local absolute paths or private setup steps
- generated prose that cannot be checked against files or artifacts

## Minimal Public Clip

A short public proof clip should show this sequence:

```text
/do setup --express
/do next
/do review README.md for first-time developer friction
/do identify the project's safest verification command and run it
/cost
```

Then show one concrete artifact: a `.planning/` report, a PR body with
verification, or a final handoff that names the files and commands involved.

For a command-generated artifact, use `.planning/operating-proof/latest.md`.

If cost telemetry is unavailable in the current runtime, show that message. The
point is visibility, not pretending every adapter has the same data.

## PR Review Rule

When a change claims to improve the public demo, first ask what new evidence the
viewer can inspect. Prefer small changes that make the loop clearer:

- a more direct first command
- a better next-action summary
- a real verification command
- a report with source paths and outcomes
- a public doc that explains how to reproduce the loop

Avoid changes that only add slogans, decorative screenshots, or broad claims
without a command path.

## Expected Outcome

This proof framing keeps Sinan's public positioning anchored to the behavior
builders care about: the agent sets up in the real repo, chooses the right
workflow, verifies against the local project, and leaves evidence that survives
the chat.
