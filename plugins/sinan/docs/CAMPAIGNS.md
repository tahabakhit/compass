# Campaigns

> last-updated: 2026-05-07

Campaigns are the persistence mechanism for multi-session work. They're the only
state that survives across context windows.

## The Pipeline

```
Intake → Brief → Plan → Build → Verify → Archive
```

1. **Intake**: Ideas enter as files in `.planning/intake/`
2. **Brief**: `/autopilot brief` researches and scopes the idea
3. **Plan**: Archon decomposes into 3-8 phases
4. **Build**: Sub-agents execute each phase
5. **Verify**: Typecheck, tests, quality checks
6. **Archive**: Campaign moves to `campaigns/completed/`

Complete and archive a finished campaign with:

```bash
node scripts/campaign.js complete <campaign-slug> --archive
```

The command refuses to complete campaigns with unfinished phases unless
`--force` is used after human review. It also writes a `## Completion Record`
for merge links, verification notes, and final evidence.

Every completion record includes a concrete outcome label:

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `shipped-pr` | A PR was merged or a merge SHA is recorded. |
| `review-package` | The campaign produced a PR or local review package ready for review. |
| `implementation-plan` | The requested deliverable is a plan rather than code. |
| `blocked-decision` | Work intentionally stops on a documented decision or approval. |
| `archived-completion` | Work is complete and archived without a more specific delivery target. |

Use `--outcome <type>` when Sinan cannot infer the right label from PR,
merge, or review-package evidence.

## Campaign File Format

```markdown
# Campaign: {Name}

Status: active | completed | parked
Started: {ISO timestamp}
Direction: {original user direction}

## Claimed Scope
- {directories this campaign modifies}

## Phases
1. [pending] Research: {what to investigate}
2. [pending] Build: {what to construct}
3. [pending] Verify: {what to check}

## Feature Ledger
| Feature | Status | Phase | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|-------|

## Decision Log
- {timestamp}: {decision}
  Reason: {why}

## Active Context
{where the campaign is right now — updated every session}

## Continuation State
Phase: {number}
Sub-step: {within the phase}
Files modified: {list}
Blocking: {any blockers}
```

## Section Purposes

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Claimed Scope | Coordination — prevents other agents from touching these files |
| Phases | Progress tracking — what's done, what's left |
| Feature Ledger | Artifact tracking — what was actually built |
| Decision Log | Prevents re-debating — choices are recorded with reasoning |
| Active Context | Human-readable status — where we are right now |
| Continuation State | Machine-readable — next Archon picks up here |

## Continuation Across Sessions

Each Archon invocation is amnesiac. It rebuilds context from:

1. **Campaign file** — state, decisions, progress
2. **CLAUDE.md** — project conventions
3. **Recent files** — what changed since last session

This is why the campaign file must be thorough. Everything Archon needs
to continue must be in the file.

## Phase Types

| Type | Purpose | Typical Duration |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| research | Read-only investigation | 15-30 min |
| plan | Architecture decisions | 15-30 min |
| build | Write code | 30-120 min |
| wire | Connect systems | 15-60 min |
| verify | Test and check | 15-30 min |
| prune | Clean up | 15-30 min |

## Phase Validation

Archon spawns a **Phase Validator** agent at the end of each build or wire phase to confirm exit conditions before the campaign advances. The validator reads the phase plan, checks actual file state, and returns `pass` or `fail` with a specific reason. On `fail`, Archon re-enters the phase rather than advancing — preventing partially-complete phases from silently propagating into later work.

For high-stakes decisions (abort, rollback, scope change), Archon may spawn 3 Phase Validators and require 2/3 agreement. A timed-out validator counts as `pass` to prevent indefinite blocking.

Campaigns can also declare an `## Exit Evidence` table. Run
`node scripts/evidence-validate.js --file <campaign.md> --target phase:<n>`
before advancing a phase. Required rows support file diffs, command results,
test results, screenshots, browser route checks, doc updates, PR links, local
review packages, review thread resolution, and hook status. Missing required
evidence reports a repair task while retries remain, then blocks advancement
when retries are exhausted.

## Policy Enforcement

Before executing Red-reversibility operations (force push, bulk delete, branch reset), Archon spawns a `policy-enforcer` agent — a read-only Haiku judge that checks the proposed action against the 3-tier constitution in `docs/CONSTITUTION.md`. A Tier 1 violation always blocks. The verdict and reason are logged to the Decision Log.

## Intake Items

Drop a markdown file in `.planning/intake/`:

```markdown
---
title: "Feature Name"
status: pending
priority: normal
target: src/path/to/area/
---

Description of what needs to be done...
```

The SessionStart hook reports pending items on every new session.
Process them with `/autopilot` or manually with `/do`.

To convert the highest-priority pending item into an evidence-backed delivery
campaign:

```bash
node scripts/deliver.js --next
```

To convert a specific intake file:

```bash
node scripts/deliver.js --intake .planning/intake/<item>.md
```

The preflight creates `.planning/campaigns/<slug>.md`, marks the intake item
`in-progress`, records claimed scope and acceptance criteria, and seeds the Exit
Evidence table. Continue with `/do continue`.

To inspect what `/do continue` will do without invoking a skill route:

```bash
node scripts/continue-action.js
```

To run any deterministic local continuation repair, such as review-package
creation, use:

```bash
node scripts/continue-action.js --run
```

To ask Sinan for the next useful harness action, inspect the dashboard-derived
operator decision:

```bash
node scripts/next-action.js
```

To let Sinan execute only deterministic local repairs, such as doc-sync drain,
review-package creation, or completed-campaign archiving, run:

```bash
node scripts/next-action.js --run
```

The operator loop re-checks dashboard state after each repair and stops at
human/agent routes such as `/do continue`, `/autopilot`, `/merge-review`, or
dirty-worktree review instead of pretending those are safe unattended repairs.
Each run writes `.planning/next-actions/latest.md` as a local operator handoff
report.

When the operator stops at a human/agent route, it also writes an approval
capsule in `.planning/approval-capsules/`. The latest capsule is available at
`.planning/approval-capsules/latest.md`, and timestamped copies preserve the
decision history. Each capsule records the requested command, boundary type,
risk level, current dashboard context, runbook, and verification plan so the
next human approval can be made without re-deriving the state from scratch.

For a single decision-first operator cockpit, use:

```bash
node scripts/operator-console.js
```

The console combines the dashboard snapshot, next-action decision, approval
boundary, artifact freshness, and selected verification profile into
`.planning/operator-console/latest.md`. Use it when you want the shortest
answer to: what is true, what should happen next, whether it can run locally,
what needs approval, and how the result should be verified.

For scripts and agents that need only the stable action contract, use:

```bash
npm run operator:summary
```

The summary includes status, command, run eligibility, approval boundary, risk,
pending work counts, artifact freshness, historical stale artifact counts,
attention-needed artifact counts, verification profile, and report paths without
the nested dashboard payload.

To let the console run deterministic local repairs before rendering the final
state, use:

```bash
node scripts/operator-console.js --run
```

Like `next-action`, the console does not execute human/agent judgment routes.
It stops at those boundaries and writes or refreshes the approval capsule.

To produce the final PR approval-readiness handoff, run verification through
the PR finalizer:

```bash
node scripts/pr-ready.js --pr https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/<number> --run-verification
```

The finalizer writes `.planning/pr-readiness/<branch>.md` and exits nonzero
unless the PR URL is valid, the worktree is clean, dashboard repairs are clear,
and the verification command exits successfully. Use `--verification "<command>"`
to override the selected primary command.

When multiple stacked PRs have readiness reports, generate the landing order:

```bash
npm run stack:plan
```

The stack plan reads `.planning/pr-readiness/*.md`, orders ready PRs by local git
ancestry, writes `.planning/stack-readiness/latest.md`, and stops at a human
approval boundary. It never marks drafts ready, merges PRs, or pushes branches.
Use `npm run stack:plan:json` for the same decision contract as JSON.
When the stack is ready, it also writes an approval capsule under
`.planning/approval-capsules/` so the merge request has the same paper trail as
other human-boundary operator actions.
If a local or remote branch ref has moved since its PR readiness report was
generated, the stack plan blocks approval until the PR finalizer is rerun for
that branch.
The operator console also reads this stack state: when local repairs are clear
and every visible PR readiness report is ready, the console promotes stack
approval as the next action instead of reporting an idle project.

Sinan selects a verification profile from changed paths when no explicit
verification command is supplied. Inspect the selected profile with:

```bash
node scripts/verification-plan.js
```

Profiles keep `npm run test` as the conservative PR-readiness primary command
when it exists, while surfacing focused recommended checks such as hook smoke
tests, skill lint, demo routing, dashboard tests, or campaign delivery tests.
The selected profile is recorded in the PR readiness report so reviewers can
see both the command that ran and the additional checks relevant to the work.

When the implementation and verification phases are ready for review, create a
deterministic review package:

```bash
node scripts/package-delivery.js <campaign-slug>
```

This writes `.planning/review-packages/<campaign-slug>.md`, records that package
in the campaign's `review-package` Exit Evidence row, and marks the packaging
phase complete. Review packages record `Outcome: review-package`, so dashboard
outcome history can distinguish review-ready work from shipped or archived work.
If a pull request already exists, record it instead:

```bash
node scripts/package-delivery.js <campaign-slug> --pr https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/<number>
```

## Repair States

The dashboard reports campaign truth problems with executable repairs:

| Status | Meaning | Repair |
|---|---|---|
| `needs-review-package` | Build and verification phases are ready, but review package evidence is still pending or invalid | `node scripts/package-delivery.js <slug>` |
| `needs-completion` | All phases are complete, but campaign status is still active | `node scripts/campaign.js complete <slug> --archive` |
| `needs-archive` | Campaign status is completed, but the file is still in `.planning/campaigns/` | `node scripts/campaign.js complete <slug> --archive` |
