# Campaign: Citadel Competitor Gap Assessment

Status: completed
Direction: Research 20 high-overlap competitors, products, repos, services, and
technique sources for Citadel; identify overlap/gaps; decide what belongs in
Citadel; produce implementation plans ready for approval.

## Phases

| # | Status | Type | Phase | Done When |
|---|--------|------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | complete | build | Local Citadel Control Plane | `npm run dashboard` renders a read-only operator snapshot and `npm run test` passes |
| 2 | complete | build | Fleet DAG and Merge Steward | `node scripts/fleet-steward.js` reports ready/blocked/mergeable Fleet work and `npm run test` passes |
| 3 | complete | build | Worktree Environment Readiness Profiles | `node scripts/worktree-readiness.js` records worktree readiness and Fleet/dashboard expose blockers |
| 4 | complete | build | Signed Telemetry and Artifact Lineage | `node scripts/verify-telemetry-integrity.js` verifies hashed telemetry/artifact records and detects tampering |
| 5 | complete | build | Memory Compiler and Semantic Blocks | `npm run memory:compile` writes five source-backed memory block types and `npm run memory:lint` passes |
| 6 | complete | build | Phase Exit Evidence Contracts | `node scripts/evidence-validate.js --file .planning/campaigns/citadel-competitor-gap-assessment.md --target phase:6` passes and missing evidence creates repair tasks |
| 7 | complete | build | Sandbox Provider Contract | `npm run sandbox:matrix` reports provider capabilities and `node scripts/test-sandbox-provider.js` passes |
| 8 | complete | build | Skill and Workflow Packaging Upgrade | `node scripts/test-skill-packaging.js` passes and `node scripts/skill-catalog.js --task-class quality` shows skills by task class/risk |
| 9 | complete | docs | Thin Runtime Adapter Matrix | `npm run runtime:matrix` reports adapter levels/tradeoffs and `node scripts/test-runtime-matrix.js` passes |
| 10 | complete | build | Shared Repo Map Substrate | `node scripts/test-map-substrate.js` passes and `node scripts/map-index.js --slice "runtime adapter"` emits a scoped map slice |

## Determinations

Accepted for implementation planning:

1. Local Citadel control-plane dashboard.
2. Dependency-aware Fleet DAG and merge steward.
3. Worktree/sandbox environment readiness profiles.
4. Signed append-only telemetry and artifact lineage.
5. Memory compiler and semantic memory blocks.
6. Phase exit evidence contracts.
7. Sandbox-provider abstraction.
8. Skill and workflow packaging upgrade.
9. Thin runtime adapter discipline.
10. Shared repo map substrate.

Monitor or defer:

- Full embedded IDE.
- Hosted SaaS agent runner.
- Broad tracker marketplace.
- Enterprise Agent Framework parity.

Rejected:

- Replacing Citadel with a general agent framework.
- Auto-merge without explicit evidence contracts.

## Decision Log

- User approved proceeding from the research package into implementation.
- Plan 1 was implemented first because it improves operational visibility while staying read-only.
- The dashboard stays CLI-first and state-derived; no separate dashboard state store was introduced.
- Plan 2 implemented Fleet DAG parsing as a core module plus a read-only-by-default steward CLI; repair-task writes require explicit `--write`.
- Fleet docs, skill guidance, and the Fleet agent prompt now share the same dependency-aware work queue shape.
- Plan 3 implemented read-only worktree readiness profiles and reports; WorktreeCreate records readiness after setup without blocking creation.
- Fleet steward now parks readiness-blocked tasks unless `--override-readiness` is explicit, and the dashboard summarizes readiness reports.
- Plan 4 implemented telemetry integrity for new records while keeping old records readable as legacy.
- Agent-run telemetry and Codex artifact evidence now include lineage IDs and `_hash`; optional HMAC uses `CITADEL_TELEMETRY_HMAC_KEY`.
- Plan 5 implemented deterministic semantic memory blocks in `.planning/memory/blocks/` with source linting and scoped loading for agents.
- `/learn` can run memory compilation directly, and `/daemon` records safe consolidation passes without allowing memory failures to create overlapping ticks.
- Plan 6 implemented optional `## Exit Evidence` contracts for campaigns and Fleet sessions, with validator output that blocks advancement or writes repair tasks for missing required evidence.
- Archon and Fleet now validate phase/task evidence before promotion when an evidence table is present.
- Plan 7 introduced a minimal sandbox provider boundary with a supported `worktree` provider and explicit unsupported `docker`/`remote` placeholders.
- Worktree creation and cleanup stay owned by native lifecycle hooks; provider v1 exposes capability matrix, attach, status, snapshot, and readiness.
- Plan 8 added optional skill packaging metadata, metadata-aware linting, a local skill catalog, and a scaffold command that emits valid SKILL.md plus optional benchmark files.
- Existing skills remain lint-clean without forced metadata migration; catalog inference fills the initial discovery gap.
- Plan 9 added explicit runtime adapter levels so Citadel can describe what each runtime guarantees instead of implying hook parity everywhere.
- Runtime matrix output is available as both human-readable CLI text and JSON for automation, and docs now list each runtime's tradeoffs.
- Plan 10 moved `/map` behavior into a shared `core/map` module with hashes, routes, package scripts, verification commands, scoped slices, and stale detection.
- Archon and Fleet now request generated map slices through `node scripts/map-index.js --slice`, keeping agent-injected orientation consistent.
