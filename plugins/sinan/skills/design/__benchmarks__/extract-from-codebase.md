## What This Tests

A user runs `/design extract the design system` on a project that has campaign context
(implying an existing codebase). The skill must scan for existing design tokens, CSS
variables, or Tailwind config and produce a structured design manifest.

## Expected Behavior

1. Detects existing codebase context from the campaign state
2. Extracts or infers color palette entries
3. Extracts or infers typography settings
4. Outputs a structured design manifest (colors, typography, spacing)
5. No crash or raw error output
