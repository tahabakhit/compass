  Use when autonomous quality improvement loop. Scores a target against a
  rubric, selects the highest-leverage axis, attacks it, verifies, documents,
  and loops. No pre-planning between iterations — each loop re-scores from

# /improve — Autonomous Quality Engine

## Orientation

Operational variants and bulky edge-case detail should live in [progressive disclosure](references/progressive-disclosure.md).

**Use when:** Scoring a target against a rubric and iteratively improving it. Rubric required at `.planning/rubrics/{target}.md` (Phase 0 creates one if missing).

**Don't use when:** Refactoring without a rubric (use `/refactor`), one-time code review (use `/review`), or debugging a specific bug (use `/systematic-debugging`).

## Invocation

```
/improve {target}            # Loop until plateau or all axes >= 8.0
/improve {target} --n=3      # Run exactly N loops then stop
/improve {target} --axis={name}  # Force-attack a specific axis (skips scoring)
/improve {target} --score-only   # Score and report, no attack
/improve {target} --continue     # Resume from campaign state (used by daemon)
/improve citadel             # Targets Sinan itself
```

`target` is a slug that maps to `.planning/rubrics/{target}.md`.
If no rubric exists, run Phase 0 first.

---

## Campaign Mode

When invoked with `--n` or `--continue`, improve operates in **campaign mode** and
maintains a campaign file that daemon can attach to.

Use the campaign file schema in [progressive disclosure](references/progressive-disclosure.md).

### Campaign lifecycle

Update `phase_within_loop` at each phase: `scoring` → `selected-{axis}` → `attacking-{axis}` → `verifying` → `not-started`.

On loop complete: increment `completed_loops`, update `next_loop`/`last_scorecard_log`/`last_outcome`, append Loop History row.

### The `--continue` flag

1. Read `.planning/campaigns/improve-{target}.md` — error if missing or `status` not `active`
2. If `completed_loops >= total_loops`: mark completed, exit
3. If `phase_within_loop` is not `not-started`: restart current loop from Phase 1 (interrupted mid-loop)
4. Load `last_scorecard_log` for delta comparison, then run Phase 1 onwards

## Protocol

### Phase 0: Rubric Bootstrap (one-time, requires human approval)

Run only when `.planning/rubrics/{target}.md` does not exist.

1. Read competitive research from `.planning/research/` if available
2. Spawn `/research-fleet` to survey comparable products if no research exists
3. Draft 8-14 axes organized into 3-5 categories, each with:
   - Weight (0.0–1.0), Category, three anchors (0/5/10), verification specs (programmatic/structural/perceptual), research inputs
4. Present draft rubric to the user with rationale for each axis
5. **STOP. Do not proceed until the user approves the rubric.**
6. Write approved rubric to `.planning/rubrics/{target}.md`

---

### Phase 1: Score

Score every axis in the rubric. No shortcuts. No cached scores from the previous loop.

#### 1a. Programmatic checks (run first, in parallel)

Execute the programmatic verification steps from the rubric. A programmatic failure caps that axis at 5 regardless of evaluator scores. Record raw results: which checks passed, which failed, what the failure was.

#### 1b. Structural analysis

Execute structural checks from each axis's verification spec:
- File path verification (do referenced files exist?)
- Schema consistency (do all skills have identical frontmatter fields?)
- Coverage ratios (what percentage of skills have benchmark scenarios?)
- Link rot (do all internal doc links resolve?)
- Cross-reference accuracy (do docs match current source?)

#### 1c. Perceptual scoring panel (three independent evaluators)

Spawn three evaluator agents in parallel. Each receives:
- The rubric with all axis definitions and anchors
- Read access to the target (repo files, demo page screenshots if applicable)
- Their persona (A/B/C as defined in the rubric's Scoring Protocol)
- Instruction: score every axis 0-10 with a one-sentence justification per axis

Each evaluator scores independently. For each axis:
- Final score = minimum of the three evaluators (plus programmatic cap if applicable)
- If any two evaluators disagree by > 3 points: flag the axis as `needs-refinement`

`needs-refinement` axes are logged but still scored. Do not halt on evaluator disagreement.

#### 1d. Compile scorecard

```
Axis        | A   | B   | C   | Prog      | Final | Delta  | Flag
------------|-----|-----|-----|-----------|-------|--------|-----
{axis_name} | {n} | {n} | {n} | PASS/FAIL | {n.n} | +{n.n} | cap
```

Final = min(A, B, C), then apply programmatic cap (sets Flag=cap). Delta = current − prior loop score (empty on loop 1).

---

### Phase 2: Select

Choose the single axis to attack this loop.

**Selection formula:**
```
score(axis) = (10 - current_score) × weight × effort_multiplier × recency_penalty
```

- `effort_multiplier`: low = 1.0, medium = 0.7, high = 0.4
- `recency_penalty`: 0.5 if attacked in previous 2 loops, otherwise 1.0
- Effort tiers: **low** < 1hr, **medium** 1-3hrs, **high** 3+hrs

If `--axis` flag was set, skip selection and attack the specified axis.

Announce the selection:
```
Selected: {axis_name} (score: {n}/10, weight: {w}, effort: {e}, selection score: {s})
Rationale: {one sentence on why this axis now, not another}
```

---

### Phase 3: Attack

Execute the improvement. Dispatch strategy depends on the axis category.

**ISOLATION MANDATE:** When dispatching to `/experiment`, `/fleet`, or `/research-fleet`, always use the Agent tool with `isolation: "worktree"`. Sub-agents in worktrees get their own context windows; the orchestrator only receives their HANDOFF results.

**technical axes** (test_coverage, hook_reliability, api_surface_consistency):
- Spawn `/experiment` for measurable improvements with before/after comparison
- Use speculative worktrees for approaches that might conflict (Agent + isolation: "worktree")
- Run `node scripts/run-with-timeout.js 300 node scripts/test-all.js` as the verification oracle

**documentation axes** (documentation_coverage, documentation_accuracy):
- Direct: read current docs, identify specific gaps or inaccuracies, rewrite them
- For coverage gaps: draft new sections, get structural verification before committing
- For accuracy gaps: cross-reference every claim against source, fix discrepancies

**experience axes** (onboarding_friction, error_recovery, command_discoverability):
- Combination: structural fixes (code, config) + documentation updates + /qa verification
- For onboarding: run the actual install flow in a clean temp dir, fix what breaks
- For error paths: inject synthetic failures per the programmatic spec, improve messages

**positioning axes** (differentiation_clarity, competitive_feature_coverage):
- Start with `/research` to verify current competitive landscape is accurate
- Then update README, FAQ, or demo page copy; /qa to verify the updated page renders

**presentation axes** (demo_page_effectiveness, readme_quality, visual_coherence):
- Read current state, identify specific structural gaps per the rubric anchors
- Make targeted changes (not rewrites unless the score is below 3)
- `/live-preview` or `/qa` to verify visual changes render correctly

**security axes** (security_posture):
- Read the specific hooks/scripts involved
- Make targeted code changes
- Run the programmatic verification steps from the rubric directly to confirm fix

#### Artifact archiving

When the attack involves trying multiple approaches:
- Write a decision record to the loop log: why the winner won
- Format: `APPROACH COMPARISON: [approach A] vs [approach B] — winner: [A] because [reason]`

---

### Phase 4: Verify

After the attack, re-score only the targeted axis (not full re-score).

Run the four verification tiers from the rubric for the targeted axis:
1. **Programmatic**: execute the specific checks, confirm they now pass
2. **Structural**: verify the structural requirements are met
3. **Perceptual**: spawn a single evaluator agent (Evaluator B — Newcomer) and score just the targeted axis
4. **Behavioral simulation**: clone the repo into a temp directory and follow QUICKSTART.md exactly as written — no prior knowledge, no shortcuts. Measure whether each step completes without error and record wall time to first successful `/do` command.
   - Required when targeted axis is: `onboarding_friction`, `error_recovery`, `documentation_accuracy`, `command_discoverability`
   - Optional for all other axes
   - Result: `PASS {wall_time}` or `FAIL at step {n}: {what broke}`
   - **A behavioral FAIL overrides a passing perceptual score.** Do not commit on behavioral FAIL.
   - Skip only if the targeted axis could not plausibly affect the user path. Plausible = axis governs code shown/executed in the app, or controls presence/absence of a UI element. Safe to skip: documentation axes (comments, docstrings), configuration-only axes, developer-tooling-only axes (e.g., `visual_coherence`, `api_surface_consistency`)

**Regression check** (run on all axes, not just targeted):
- Re-run programmatic checks on every axis that shares files with the changes
- If any previously passing axis now fails programmatic: **abort, do not commit**
- If perceptual estimate suggests any axis dropped > 0.5 from baseline: **abort, do not commit**

On abort: revert the changes, log the failure, treat as "no improvement this loop".

On pass: commit the changes with a descriptive message.

---

### Phase 5: Document

Write the loop log. Always. Even on abort.

Use the loop-log template in [progressive disclosure](references/progressive-disclosure.md).
All proposals go to `.planning/rubrics/{target}-proposals.md`. Never to the live rubric.

---

### Phase 6: Loop or Exit

**Exit conditions (check in order):**

1. `--n` flag was set and N loops have completed: exit, report scorecard
2. All axes >= 8.0: exit with "target has reached quality ceiling"
3. No axis improved > 0.5 in either of the last 2 loops AND no programmatic cap is active AND at least 3 loops have completed: **trigger Level-Up Protocol**
3a. A programmatic cap IS active AND the capped axis has not improved for 2 loops: **trigger Level-Up Protocol.** The cap is preventing score movement, not enforcing a ceiling — do not loop indefinitely.
4. The user said stop: exit immediately

**On Level-Up**: do not exit. Escalate. See Level-Up Protocol section.

**On ceiling (all >= 8.0)**: report the final scorecard and recommend a Level-Up run.

**On normal loop**: return to Phase 1. Re-score everything from scratch.

**Campaign mode exit handling:**

- **n-complete** (all loops done): set `status: completed`, move to `completed/`
- **ceiling** (all axes >= 8.0): set `status: completed`, move to `completed/`
- **level-up-triggered**: set `status: level-up-pending` (daemon will pause, not retry)
- **aborted** (security failure, unrecoverable regression): set `status: parked`
- **plateau** (no improvement, not yet level-up): set `status: parked` with reason
- **user-stopped**: set `status: paused`

---

### Level-Up Protocol

Load [progressive disclosure](references/progressive-disclosure.md) for the
level-up snapshot, proposal, approval, and evaluator-baseline details. The
non-negotiable rule is unchanged: the loop must halt for human approval and
must not edit the live rubric directly.

---

## Fringe Cases

- **No rubric**: run Phase 0, halt for human approval. Never improvise.
- **Evaluators disagree > 3 pts**: log `needs-refinement`, use minimum score, continue.
- **Programmatic checks can't be automated**: use structural + perceptual only, cap axis at 8.
- **No improvement this loop**: document as "no-change", apply recency penalty.
- **Loop 1 (no prior logs)**: delta fields empty — expected.
- **Security axis fails programmatic**: halt and report. Blocking.
- **`--continue` + no campaign file**: error, suggest `--n`.
- **`--continue` + `level-up-pending`**: halt, point to proposals file, require human approval then `status: active`.
- **`--continue` + `completed`**: do not resume, report final scorecard.
- **`--n` + existing active campaign**: treat as `--continue`. If completed/parked: new campaign, incremented slug.

---

## Quality Gates

- Phase 0 requires human approval. No exceptions.
- Phase 4 regression check must run. No committing without it.
- Phase 4 behavioral simulation result must appear in the loop log for applicable axes. Behavioral FAIL blocks commit regardless of perceptual score.
- Phase 5 loop log must be written. Even on abort, even on no-change.
- Perceptual scoring: all three evaluators required for Phase 1. Single evaluator acceptable for Phase 4 spot-check only.
- Selection formula must be shown in output.
- Any axis with a programmatic failure is capped at 5. Cannot be overridden.
- **The loop never writes to the live rubric.** Proposals go to `.planning/rubrics/{target}-proposals.md` only. Human approval required.
- Level-Up Protocol requires human approval before resuming
- **Campaign mode:** campaign file must be updated after every phase transition and every loop completion.
- **Campaign mode:** level-up must set `status: level-up-pending`, not `parked` or `active`.

---

## Contextual Gates

**Disclosure:** State loop count, target, per-loop cost (~$12), total estimate. For `--continue`: loops remaining and spend so far. For unlimited: state exit conditions (plateau or all axes >= 8.0).

**Reversibility:** Green = `--score-only` | Amber = standard loops (each commits separately) | Red = level-up (rewrites rubric anchors permanently). Red requires explicit confirmation.

**Proportionality:** No rubric + no explicit request → suggest `/review`. All axes > 8.0 + `--n=1` → suggest `--axis`. Cost > $50 → confirm.

**Trust gating:** Novice (0-4): `--score-only` / `--n=1` only. Familiar (5-19): up to `--n=5`. Trusted (20+): no cap; confirm unlimited or cost > $50.
