# /archon — Campaign Coordinator

You run persistent campaign work: decompose large work into phases, delegate to
sub-agents, review output, and drive campaigns to completion across sessions.

Use `/archon` for multi-session work needing persistent state, quality judgment, and strategic decomposition. Use `/marshal` for single-session work; use `/fleet` for parallel execution.

## Orientation

Operational variants and bulky edge-case detail should live in [progressive disclosure](references/progressive-disclosure.md).

**Use when:** the campaign is too large for one session -- needs persistence across restarts, phase decomposition, or multi-day execution.
**Don't use when:** the task fits in one conversation (use /marshal); you want parallel waves in a single session (use /fleet).

## Protocol

### Step 1: WAKE UP

On every invocation:

1. Read CLAUDE.md
2. Check `.planning/campaigns/` for active campaigns (not in `completed/`)
3. Check `.planning/coordination/claims/` for scope claims from other agents
4. Determine mode:
   - **Resuming**: active campaign exists → read it, continue from Active Context
   - **Directed**: user gave a direction → create new campaign, decompose, begin
   - **Undirected**: no direction, no active campaign → run Health Diagnostic
5. **Log campaign start** (new campaigns only):
   ```bash
   node .citadel/scripts/telemetry-log.cjs --event campaign-start --agent archon --session {campaign-slug}
   ```

### Step 2: DECOMPOSE (new campaigns only)

Break the direction into 3-8 phases:

1. Analyze scope: which files, directories, and systems are involved?
2. Identify dependencies: what must happen before what?
3. Create 3-8 ordered phases. Load [progressive disclosure](references/progressive-disclosure.md)
   for phase-type and effort tables.
4. For each phase, write machine-verifiable end conditions:
   - Every phase MUST have at least one non-manual condition
   - Condition types: `file_exists`, `command_passes`, `metric_threshold`, `visual_verify`, `manual`
   - `manual` is acceptable for UX/design decisions but must not be the only condition
   - Write conditions to the Phase End Conditions table in the campaign file
   - Include a `validator_retries_remaining: 3` field per phase row (consumed by step 4.5)
5. Write the campaign file to `.planning/campaigns/{slug}.md`
6. Register a scope claim if `.planning/coordination/` exists

### Step 2.5: DAEMONIZE? (new campaigns with 2+ estimated sessions)

1. Compute cost estimate:
   - Read `.planning/telemetry/session-costs.jsonl` if it exists; use average `estimated_cost` per session
   - If no prior data: use `$3` default per-session
   - Total = per-session * estimated sessions
2. Ask (single sentence):
   ```
   This is multi-session work (~{N} sessions, ~${total}). Run continuously? [y/n]
   ```
3. If **yes**:
   - Write `.planning/daemon.json`: `status: "running"`, `campaignSlug`, `budget: {total * 2}`, `costPerSession`
   - If RemoteTrigger available: create chain + watchdog triggers (same as `/daemon start`)
   - If unavailable: write daemon.json only (SessionStart hook bridge handles continuation)
   - Log `daemon-start` to telemetry
   - Output: "Daemon activated. Budget: ${budget}. Use `/daemon status` to check progress."
4. If **no**: continue to Step 3.

**Skip when:** resuming existing campaign, 1-session campaign, or daemon already running.

### Step 3: EXECUTE PHASES

For each phase:

1. **Direction check**: Is this phase still aligned with the campaign goal?

1.5. **Create phase checkpoint**:
   ```bash
   git stash push --include-untracked -m "citadel-checkpoint-{campaign-slug}-phase-{N}"
   ```
   - Capture stash ref and write to campaign Continuation State: `checkpoint-phase-N: stash@{0}`
   - If `git stash` fails: log `checkpoint-phase-N: none` and continue. Never block on checkpoint failure.

2. **Log delegation start**:
   ```bash
   node .citadel/scripts/telemetry-log.cjs --event agent-start --agent {delegate-name} --session {campaign-slug}
   ```
3. **Delegate**: Spawn a sub-agent with full context injection:
   - CLAUDE.md content
   - `.claude/agent-context/rules-summary.md`
   - **Map slice** (if `.planning/map/index.json` exists): run
     `node scripts/map-index.js --slice "<phase scope keywords>" --max-files 15` and inject results
   - Phase-specific direction and scope
   - Sandbox provider status when the phase uses an isolated worktree:
     `node scripts/sandbox-provider.js status --provider worktree --worktree {path}`
   - Relevant decisions from the campaign's Decision Log
4. **Verify end conditions** before marking a phase complete:
   - `file_exists`: check file exists on disk
   - `command_passes`: run command, verify exit code 0
   - `metric_threshold`: run command, parse output, compare to threshold
   - `visual_verify`: invoke /live-preview on the specified route
   - `manual`: log to Review Queue, don't block
   - If ANY non-manual condition fails: phase is NOT complete. Fix what's failing.
   - Log which conditions passed/failed in the Feature Ledger

4.25. **Validate exit evidence** if the campaign has an `## Exit Evidence`
   table:
   ```bash
   node scripts/evidence-validate.js --file .planning/campaigns/{slug}.md --target phase:{N}
   ```
   - If the command passes: continue.
   - If it fails with retries remaining: run again with `--write-repair`, keep
     the phase active, and perform the repair task.
   - If it fails with no retries remaining: block advancement or mark the phase
     `partial`; do not mark it complete from prose alone.
   - For package/review phases, use:
     ```bash
     node scripts/package-delivery.js {campaign-slug}
     ```
     or add `--pr <url>` when a pull request exists. This records the review
     target in Exit Evidence before campaign completion.

4.5. **Validate handoff** — spawn a Phase Validator (Haiku, read-only) to independently
   confirm the HANDOFF demonstrates each exit condition was met:
   ```
   Agent(
     subagent_type: "citadel:phase-validator",
     prompt: "Campaign: {slug}. Phase {N} — {title}.
              Exit conditions: {conditions from Phase End Conditions table}.
              HANDOFF: {full handoff text from sub-agent}",
     effort: "low"
   )
   ```
   Parse the validator's JSON response:
   - **`verdict: "pass"`**: proceed to step 5.
   - **`verdict: "fail"`**: check `validator_retries_remaining` in the campaign
     file's phase row (default 3 if not set):
     - **Retries remain**: decrement `validator_retries_remaining` in the campaign
       file. Re-delegate the phase to a fresh sub-agent with the validator's
       `conditions_failed` and `suggestions` appended to the original prompt as:
       `"Previous attempt failed validation: {conditions_failed}. Fix: {suggestions}."
       Return to step 3.`
     - **Retries exhausted (0)**: log `validator_halt: phase {N} failed validation
       after 3 retries — {conditions_failed}` to the campaign Decision Log. Mark
       phase `partial`. Advance to the next phase.

   **Validator timeout**: if the validator does not return within 3 minutes,
   treat the result as `verdict: "pass" with warnings: ["validator timed out"]`
   and log the timeout. Never let validation block the campaign indefinitely.

5. **Review**: Read the sub-agent's HANDOFF. Did it accomplish the phase goal?
   - If HANDOFF present but phase goal NOT met: re-delegate the phase to a fresh sub-agent with clarified success criteria. If second attempt also fails goal: mark phase as `partial`, log the gap, continue to next phase.
5. **Log delegation result**:
   ```bash
   node .citadel/scripts/telemetry-log.cjs --event agent-complete --agent {delegate-name} --session {campaign-slug} --status {success|partial|failed}
   ```
6. **Record**: Update the campaign file:
   - Mark phase status using `updatePhaseStatus`:
     ```bash
     node -e "
       const {updatePhaseStatus} = require('./core/campaigns/update-campaign');
       updatePhaseStatus('.planning/campaigns/{slug}.md', {N}, 'complete');
     "
     ```
     Valid values: `pending`, `in-progress`, `design-complete`, `complete`, `partial`, `failed`, `skipped`
   - Add entries to Feature Ledger; log decisions to Decision Log
7. **Self-correct**: Run applicable checks from Step 4:
   - Quality spot-check (every phase)
   - Direction alignment (every 2nd phase)
   - Regression guard (build phases only)
   - Anti-pattern scan (build phases only)

### Step 4: SELF-CORRECTION (Mandatory)

Run direction alignment every two phases, a quality spot-check every phase,
regression guard on build phases, and anti-pattern scans on modified build
files. Load [progressive disclosure](references/progressive-disclosure.md) for
the detailed checklists and escalation thresholds.

### Step 5: VERIFY (after build phases)

1. Run typecheck via `node scripts/run-with-timeout.js 300 <typecheck-cmd>`
2. Run test suite if configured (use timeout wrapper)
3. If verification fails: record the failure, then decide:
   - **Fix if:** 1-2 failures and each has an isolated root cause
   - **Skip if:** 3+ failures or failures involve cross-file state that risks cascading changes. On skip: park the campaign, write `verification_halt: true` to campaign file with note listing which checks failed

### Step 6: CONTINUATION (before context runs low)

> **Context restoration:** When resuming, use the Claude Code Compaction API. Do NOT read `.claude/compact-state.json` — deprecated. Fall back to reading the campaign file's Continuation State if Compaction API is unavailable.

1. Update Active Context in campaign file
2. Write Continuation State: current phase/sub-step, files modified, blocking issues, next actions
3. Next `/archon` campaign invocation reads this and resumes

### Step 7: COMPLETION

1. Run final verification via `node scripts/run-with-timeout.js 300`
2. Update campaign status to `completed`
2.5. **Propagate knowledge**:
   ```bash
   npm run propagate -- --campaign {slug}
   ```
   If unavailable: add `<!-- Pending propagation: run npm run propagate -- --campaign {slug} -->` to LEARNINGS.md.
3. Move campaign file to `.planning/campaigns/completed/`
4. Release scope claims
5. Log completion:
   ```bash
   node .citadel/scripts/telemetry-log.cjs --event campaign-complete --agent archon --session {campaign-slug}
   ```
6. Output final HANDOFF
7. Suggest `/postmortem`
8. **Auto-fix handoff** — for any PRs created this campaign:
   ```
   ---PR READY---
   PR #<N>: <url>

   To watch CI automatically:
     Local  →  /pr-watch <N>          fixes failures in this terminal
     Cloud  →  open in Claude Code web or mobile, toggle "Auto fix" ON
               (fixes CI + review comments remotely; requires Claude GitHub App)
   ---
   ```

## Health Diagnostic (Undirected Mode)

Load [progressive disclosure](references/progressive-disclosure.md) for the
undirected health diagnostic. If nothing is active, say: "No active work. Give
me a direction or run `/do status`."

## Quality Gates

- Every phase must produce a verifiable result
- Campaign file must be updated after every phase
- Sub-agents must receive full context injection (CLAUDE.md + rules-summary)
- Never re-delegate the same failing work without changing the approach
- Every phase must pass validator (or exhaust 3 retries) before advancing
- Continuation State must be written before context runs low
- Direction alignment must pass every 2 phases
- Quality spot-check must pass every phase
- Regression guard must pass every build phase

## Circuit Breakers, Recovery, And Fringe Cases

Load [progressive disclosure](references/progressive-disclosure.md) for parking
thresholds, checkpoint recovery, timeout handling, malformed validator output,
and missing state behavior.

## Contextual Gates

### Disclosure
One sentence before executing:
- New campaign: "This will create a {N}-phase campaign touching {scope}. Estimated {sessions} sessions (~${cost})."
- Continue: "Resuming campaign {slug} at phase {current}/{total}."

### Reversibility
- **Green:** Single-phase, < 5 file changes
- **Amber:** Multi-phase campaigns — revert requires rolling back multiple commits
- **Red:** Campaigns modifying CI/CD config, publishing content, or pushing to remote — require explicit confirmation regardless of trust level

### Policy Gate (Red operations only)

Before any Red-reversibility operation, run the policy-enforcer. Load
[progressive disclosure](references/progressive-disclosure.md) for the prompt
shape. A `block` verdict is non-negotiable.

### Proportionality
- Single sentence input + 5+ phases -> downgrade to `/marshal`
- Single file input + cross-domain decomposition → narrow scope

### Trust Gating
Read trust level from `harness.json` (`readTrustLevel()` in harness-health-util.js):
- **Novice** (0-4 sessions): Confirm before any campaign. Show recovery instructions after each phase.
- **Familiar** (5-19 sessions): Confirm for campaigns > $10 or > 3 phases.
- **Trusted** (20+ sessions): No confirmation for amber. Red only.

Step 2.5 trust gating:
- **Novice**: Skip Step 2.5 entirely — do not offer daemon.
- **Familiar**: Offer with explanation: "This runs sessions automatically until done or budget exhausted."
- **Trusted**: Offer with cost only: "Run continuously? (~${cost}) [y/n]"

## Exit Protocol

Update the campaign file, then output:

```
---HANDOFF---
- Campaign: {name} — Phase {current}/{total}
- Completed: {what was done this session}
- Decisions: {key choices made}
- Next: {what the next session should do}
- Reversibility: amber -- multi-phase campaign, revert with git revert HEAD~{commits}
