## What This Tests

The `.citadel/scripts/grid.cjs` file is not present (project not initialized).
The skill must fall back to the inline Grid class template from the protocol
and still produce a correct diagram.

This tests that the fringe case is handled gracefully — the skill doesn't crash
or refuse, it uses the embedded fallback.

## Expected Behavior

1. Skill cannot find `.citadel/scripts/grid.cjs`
2. Falls back to the inline Grid class (copy-paste template from Step 2)
3. Produces a valid diagram with "client" and "server" boxes
4. Does NOT say "I cannot" or produce an error
