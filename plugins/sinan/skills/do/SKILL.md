name: do
description: >-
  Use when unified router that auto-routes user intent to the right
  orchestrator or skill. Classifies input by scope, complexity, persistence
  needs, and parallelism, then dispatches to the cheapest path that can handle
  it: direct command, skill, marshal, archon, or fleet. Single entry point for
  all work.

# /do — Unified Intent Router

## Orientation

Use `/do` when the user wants something done but doesn't know (or care) which tool handles it.
**Don't use when:** you know the destination — invoke /marshal, /archon, /fleet, or any skill directly.

## Commands

| Command | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `/do [anything]` | Classify intent, route to cheapest capable path |
| `/do status` | Show full harness dashboard (/dashboard) |
| `/do next` | Run the decision-first operator console for the next useful harness action |
| `/do operator` | Show the operator console without executing repairs |
| `/do preview <request>` | Show route, alternatives, boundary, and verification without executing |
| `/do continue` | Resolve and run the deterministic continuation action |
| `/do --list` | Show all skills grouped by category with trigger keywords |
| `/do setup` | First-run experience — configure the harness for this project |

## Protocol

Classification runs top-to-bottom. First match wins. Each tier is cheaper than the next.

### Runtime-Native and Token-Efficient Policy

Before choosing a Sinan-specific path, prefer the host runtime's first-class
surface when it exists:

- Codex: use the native plan/checklist surface for multi-step work, native
  thread/automation tools for scheduling or follow-ups, `@codex review` for
  GitHub-visible PR review, and local shell/file tools for exact repository
  inspection.
- Claude Code: use its native todo/plan/checklist, plugin, MCP, hook, and
  permission surfaces instead of reimplementing those flows in markdown.
- Cross-runtime: keep Sinan as the primary router, then delegate to native
  tools for execution details where the runtime already has a stronger
  primitive.
- Search: prefer `rg` and `rg --files` for exact local code/file discovery;
  fall back to `grep` only when `rg` is unavailable.
- Reading: cap command output, read targeted ranges, use structured local
  scripts/MCP summaries before loading whole files or directories, and avoid
  broad recursive reads when a scoped query or artifact already answers the
  question.

### Step 0: Skill Registry Check (Cost: ~0 on hit | ~50 tokens on miss)

Before routing, check if new skills have been added since last registration.

1. Count installed Sinan skills (built-in from plugin + custom in project's `.claude/skills/`)
2. Read `registeredSkillCount` from `.claude/harness.json`
3. **If counts match**: continue to Tier 0. Zero cost.
4. **If counts differ** (or harness.json doesn't exist yet):
   a. Read the `registeredSkills` array from harness.json (default: `[]`)
   b. Diff skill names against the registered list
   c. For each unknown skill: read ONLY lines 1-10 of its `SKILL.md` (frontmatter)
   d. Extract `name` and `description` from frontmatter
   e. Add the skill to the Tier 2 keyword table for this session using its
      `name` and `description` words as match targets
   f. Log to the user: `"Discovered {N} new skill(s): {names}. Run /do setup to permanently register routing keywords."`
   g. Update `registeredSkillCount` and `registeredSkills` array in harness.json

**This means:**
- 99% of invocations: one number comparison, zero file reads
- New skill dropped in: reads only the new frontmatter, routes immediately
- `/do setup` does a full registry rebuild with permanent keyword assignment

### Tier 0: Pattern Match (Cost: ~0 tokens | Latency: <1ms)

Regex/keyword on raw input. Catches trivial commands:

| Pattern | Action |
|---|---|
| "typecheck" or "type check" | Run the project's typecheck command |
| "build" | Run the project's build command |
| "test" or "tests" | Run the project's test command |
| "status", "dashboard", "what's happening", "what's going on", "show activity" | Show full harness dashboard (/dashboard) |
| "next", "what should I do next", "fix harness state", "repair harness" | Run `node scripts/operator-console.js --run`; if it stops on a skill route or human-review action, report the boundary, risk, next command, and verification profile |
| "operator", "operator console", "what's up", "what should happen next", "approval capsule" | Run `node scripts/operator-console.js`; report the decision, boundary, artifact freshness, and verification profile |
| "preview route", "route preview", "dry run route", "what would /do do" | Run `node scripts/route-preview.js -- "<request>"`; report selected route, alternatives, boundary, and verification profile |
| "continue" or "keep going" | Run `node scripts/continue-action.js --run`; invoke the returned skill route if it prints `/archon continue` or `/fleet continue` |
| "setup" | Run `/do setup` first-run experience |
| "deliver <intake-file>" | Run `node scripts/deliver.js --intake <file>` to create an evidence-backed delivery campaign |
| "deliver intake" or "deliver next intake" | Run `node scripts/deliver.js --next` to create an evidence-backed delivery campaign from the highest-priority pending intake item |
| "package delivery" or "review package" | Run `node scripts/package-delivery.js <campaign-slug>` to create a local review handoff and update campaign evidence |
| "pr ready" or "ready for review" | Run `node scripts/pr-ready.js --pr <pull-request-url> --run-verification` to produce an approval-readiness handoff |
| "--list" or "list" | Show all available skills |
| "fix typo in X" or "rename X to Y" | Direct edit (no orchestrator needed) |
| "commit" | Stage and commit changes |
| "rollback", "undo phase", "restore checkpoint" | Find active campaign, read latest checkpoint ref, run git stash pop |

If matched → execute directly. Done.

### Tier 1: Active State Short-Circuit (Cost: ~0 tokens | Latency: <100ms)

Check for active campaigns or fleet sessions that match the input scope:

0. For input exactly equivalent to `continue`, first run:
   ```bash
   node scripts/continue-action.js --run
   ```
   - If it executes a local command such as `node scripts/package-delivery.js <slug>`, report the output and stop.
   - If it returns `/archon continue`, invoke `/archon continue`.
   - If it returns `/fleet continue`, invoke `/fleet continue`.
   - If it returns no command, output "No active campaign or fleet session found. Nothing to continue."
1. Read `.planning/campaigns/` for files with `Status: active` or `status: active` in frontmatter
2. Read `.planning/fleet/` for session files with `status: active` or `needs-continue`
3. **Review-package campaigns:** if the campaign status is `needs-review-package`
   or its `review-package` Exit Evidence row is pending while prior phases are
   complete, route to `node scripts/package-delivery.js <slug>` before Archon.
4. **Improve campaigns (type: improve):** if the active campaign has `type: improve` in
   frontmatter, route to `/improve {target} --continue` where `{target}` is the campaign's
   `target` field. Do NOT route improve campaigns to archon -- improve is its own orchestrator.
5. If input scope matches a non-improve active campaign → `/archon continue`
6. If fleet session needs continuation → `/fleet continue`
7. If input mentions a campaign by name → resume it (check type field for routing)
8. **If input is "continue" but NO active campaign or fleet session found:**
   - Output: "No active campaign or fleet session found. Nothing to continue."
   - **If `.planning/daemon.json` exists with `status: "running"`:** the daemon spawned
     this session but there's no work to do. Update daemon.json:
     `status: "stopped"`, `stopReason: "no-active-work"`,
     `stoppedAt: "{ISO timestamp}"`. Delete both triggers if IDs are present.
     Output: "[daemon] Stopped -- no active campaign found. The work is done."
   - Exit. Do NOT fall through to Tier 2 or 3.

If matched → resume the active work. Done.

### Tier 2: Skill Keyword Match (Cost: ~0 tokens | Latency: <10ms)

Match input against installed skill keywords from Sinan's built-in skills
and any project-level custom skills in `.claude/skills/`.

**Built-in skill triggers:**

| "workspace", "multi-repo", "cross-repo", "across repos", "multiple repos", "coordinate repos", "add redis and snowflake", "split into repos" | `/workspace` |

If ONE skill matches with high confidence → invoke it directly. Done.
High confidence = evaluator assigns ≥ 0.85 probability to exactly one skill. Below 0.85, or multiple skills above 0.70, fall through to Tier 3.
If MULTIPLE skills match → carry the candidate set to Tier 3. Tier 3 disambiguates between candidates only, not from scratch. Tie-break: prefer the candidate with fewer trigger keywords.

### Tier 3: LLM Complexity Classifier (Cost: ~500 tokens | Latency: ~1-2s)

When Tiers 0-2 don't resolve, classify across 6 dimensions:

```
SCOPE: single-file | single-domain | cross-domain | platform-wide
COMPLEXITY: 1 (trivial) | 2 (simple) | 3 (moderate) | 4 (complex) | 5 (campaign)
INTENT: fix | build | create | add | audit | redesign | research | improve | wire | prune
REQUIRES_PERSISTENCE: true | false (multi-session?)
REQUIRES_PARALLEL: true | false (independent sub-tasks?)
REQUIRES_TASTE: true | false (quality judgment beyond tests?)
```

**Routing rules (first match wins):**

| Condition | Route |
|---|---|
| INTENT is "create", Complexity >= 3 | `/create-app` |
| INTENT is "create", Complexity <= 2 | `/scaffold` |
| INTENT is "add", existing source files present | `/create-app` (Tier 5 — feature mode) |
| INTENT is "add", no existing source files | `/scaffold` |
| Complexity 1, single skill match | Skill directly |
| Complexity 1, no skill match | Do it yourself (direct edit) |
| Complexity 2, single domain | `/marshal` |
| Complexity 2-3, known skill domain | Skill, with marshal fallback |
| Complexity 3, cross-domain | `/marshal` |
| Complexity 3-4, requires persistence | `/archon` |
| Complexity 4, requires taste/judgment | `/archon` |
| Complexity 4-5, requires parallel | `/fleet` |
| Complexity 5, platform-wide | `/fleet` |
| Confidence < 0.7 | `/marshal` (safe default) |

**Important:** A repeated pattern complaint ("I keep doing X manually", "the agent
always makes this mistake") should route to `/create-skill`. A repeated pattern
is a skill waiting to be extracted.

### Step 3.5: Proportionality Check

After classification and before execution, verify the response is proportional to the input:

**Downgrade triggers (apply in order):**

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Input < 20 words AND routed to Archon or Fleet | Downgrade to Marshal. Log: "Input too brief for campaign-level orchestration." |
| Input mentions a single file AND routed to Fleet | Downgrade to Marshal or skill. Log: "Single-file scope doesn't warrant parallel agents." |
| Estimated sessions > 5 AND user is Novice trust level | Cap at 3 sessions. Log: "Capping sessions for novice user. Run more to unlock higher budgets." |
| Routed to Daemon AND user is Novice trust level | Block. Output: "Daemon mode requires familiarity with the harness. Complete a few sessions first." |
| Estimated cost > $50 AND no explicit budget flag | Confirm with user regardless of trust level. |

**Upgrade triggers:**

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Input complexity >= 4 AND routed to a bare skill | Suggest Marshal. "This looks complex enough for orchestration. Route to /marshal instead?" |
| Input mentions "overnight" or "continuous" AND routed to Archon | Suggest daemon. "This sounds like continuous work. Want to run it as a daemon?" (skip if Novice) |
| Input contains 2+ clearly independent tasks AND complexity >= 3 | Run Fleet auto-decomposition (see below). |

**Fleet auto-decomposition — 1/2/3 confirmation prompt:**

When 2+ independent tasks detected (non-overlapping scopes, complexity >= 3, not already routed to full Fleet), read `consent.fleetSpawn` from harness.json:
- `auto-allow` → route directly to `/fleet --quick`
- `always-ask` or `null` → show prompt: "These look independent — run in parallel? [1=yes  2=always  3=no]"
  - 1: route to `--quick`, preference unchanged
  - 2: route to `--quick`, write `writeConsent('fleetSpawn', 'auto-allow')`
  - 3: run sequentially; if "don't ask again", write `always-ask`

`readConsent`/`writeConsent` are in `hooks_src/harness-health-util.js`.

**Trust level:** Read from `harness.json` `trust` object. Levels: novice (0-4 sessions), familiar (5-19), trusted (20+ with 2+ campaigns). `trust.override` takes precedence.

### Step 4: After Classification

1. **Log routing decision** (fire-and-forget):
   `node .sinan/scripts/telemetry-log.cjs --event agent-complete --agent do-router --session routing --status success --meta '{"tier":N,"target":"[skill]","input_chars":M}'`

   Use `.sinan/scripts/telemetry-log.cjs` (the project-local copy). If it doesn't exist, skip logging silently — never block routing on telemetry failure.

2. **Announce the routing decision**: "Routing to [target] because [one-sentence reason]"
3. **Invoke the target** skill or orchestrator
4. If the target fails or the user says "wrong tool", try the next tier up. If the target is already Tier 3 (marshal fails or user explicitly escalates from a failed marshal attempt): re-route to `/archon` with the original input as context.

## /do --list

Output a grouped skill list drawn from the system reminder's available skills. Group by category (Orchestration, App Creation, Code Quality, Research & Debugging, GitHub & CI, Infrastructure, Monitoring, Utilities, Observability). For each skill, show `/name  — one-line description`. Include a footer: "Direct invocation (/skill-name) always bypasses the router."

## Fringe Cases

- **`.planning/` does not exist**: The router works without `.planning/`. Tiers 0, 2, and 3 are fully independent of it. Tier 1 (active-state short-circuit) reads `.planning/campaigns/` and `.planning/fleet/` — if those directories are absent, skip Tier 1 gracefully and fall through to Tier 2. Never crash on a missing `.planning/` directory.
- **`harness.json` missing**: Skip the Skill Registry Check and proceed directly to Tier 0. Announce discovered skills from the filesystem if counts can be read, otherwise route from built-in keywords.
- **Multiple skills match at Tier 2**: Carry candidates to Tier 3 per Tier 2 disambiguation rule above.
- **User input is empty or whitespace**: Respond with the `--list` output and a prompt to provide a direction.
- **Routed skill not found**: Report "Skill not found" and fall back to Marshal as the safe default.

## Contextual Gates

**Disclosure:** "Routing to [skill]. See that skill's contextual gates for reversibility."
**Reversibility:** depends on routed skill — check the routed skill's reversibility
**Trust gates:**
- Any: routing and dispatch; inherits trust gates from the routed skill.

## Quality Gates

- Tier 0-2 must resolve in under 1 second
- Tier 3 classification must be transparent (announce reasoning)
- Never route a trivial task (complexity 1) to Archon or Fleet
- Never route a multi-session task to a bare skill
- If routing fails, default to Marshal (safe middle ground)

## Exit Protocol

After routing and execution complete:
- If the routed skill/orchestrator produces a HANDOFF, relay it to the user
- If the task was trivial (Tier 0), just show the result
- Do not add overhead to simple tasks
- Telemetry is fire-and-forget — never surface telemetry errors to the user
