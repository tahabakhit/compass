## What This Tests

A user invokes Fleet on a fresh project where `.planning/fleet/` does not yet exist.
Fleet must create the session directory itself rather than crashing on a missing path.
This is the first-run experience for Fleet on any new project.

## Expected Behavior

1. Fleet reads CLAUDE.md and checks for active campaigns
2. Decomposes "build the auth module in parallel" into independent streams
3. Creates `.planning/fleet/` if it does not exist before writing the session file
4. Writes the session file and logs session start
5. No raw filesystem errors appear — the missing directory is created, not reported as an error
