# /infra-audit -- Infrastructure Auditor

## When to Use

- Before adding a new database, cache, or queue to a project
- When onboarding to an unfamiliar codebase and need to understand its infra
- Before planning a workspace campaign that spans multiple services
- When someone asks "what systems does this project talk to?"

**Do not use when:**
- The user already knows the infra and just wants to wire something up (use `/architect`)
- The question is about code architecture, not infrastructure (use `/research`)

## Protocol

### Step 1: DISCOVER

Scan the project for infrastructure configuration files. Check each category:

**Container orchestration:**
- `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.*.yml`
- `Dockerfile`, `*.dockerfile`
- `k8s/`, `kubernetes/`, `helm/`, `charts/`

**Environment and secrets:**
- `.env`, `.env.*`, `.env.example`, `.env.local`
- `*.env` files in config directories

**Database and ORM:**
- Prisma: `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Drizzle: `drizzle.config.ts`, `drizzle/`
- TypeORM: `ormconfig.*`, `data-source.ts`
- Sequelize: `.sequelizerc`, `config/database.*`
- Knex: `knexfile.*`
- SQLAlchemy: `alembic.ini`, `alembic/`
- Django: `settings.py` (DATABASES section)
- Rails: `config/database.yml`
- Go: look for `pgx`, `gorm`, `sqlx` in go.mod

**Message queues and event streaming:**
- Redis: connection strings, `ioredis`, `redis` in package.json/requirements.txt/go.mod
- RabbitMQ: `amqplib`, `pika`, `amqp` imports
- Kafka: `kafkajs`, `confluent-kafka`, `sarama` imports
- NATS: `nats`, `nats.go` imports
- SQS/SNS: `@aws-sdk/client-sqs`, `boto3` sqs references

**Cache:**
- Redis (dual-use -- note if used as cache vs. pub/sub vs. primary store)
- Memcached: `memcached`, `pylibmc` imports

**Search:**
- Elasticsearch: `@elastic/elasticsearch`, `elasticsearch-py`
- Meilisearch, Typesense, Algolia client libraries

**Object storage:**
- S3: `@aws-sdk/client-s3`, `boto3` s3 references
- MinIO, GCS, Azure Blob client libraries

**External APIs:**
- Stripe, Twilio, SendGrid, Auth0, Firebase, Supabase client libraries
- Any `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` or `VITE_*` env vars pointing to external services

**CI/CD:**
- `.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, `bitbucket-pipelines.yml`

For each discovered item, record:
- **What**: the system (e.g., "PostgreSQL 15")
- **Where**: config file path and line
- **How**: connection method (direct, pooled, ORM, SDK)
- **Role**: primary store, cache, queue, search, auth, etc.

### Step 2: TRACE CONNECTIONS

For each discovered system, trace how the application connects:

1. Find connection strings in env files or config
2. Find the client initialization code (imports, `new Client()`, `createPool()`)
3. Identify which modules/services use this connection
4. Note connection pooling, retry logic, health checks if present

Build a connection graph:
```
App --> [pool: 10] --> PostgreSQL (primary store)
App --> [ioredis]  --> Redis (cache + pub/sub)
App --> [SDK]      --> Stripe (payments)
```

### Step 3: ANALYZE PATTERNS

Based on what's connected and how it's used, identify:

**Access patterns:**
- Read-heavy vs. write-heavy (look at query patterns in ORM usage)
- Real-time vs. batch (WebSocket/SSE presence, cron jobs)
- Request/response vs. event-driven (queue usage, webhook handlers)

**Missing layers** (flag only when evidence supports the need):

| Signal | Likely Missing | Evidence Required |
|---|---|---|
| Repeated identical DB queries in hot paths | Cache layer (Redis/Memcached) | Same query in 3+ request handlers |
| `setTimeout`/`setInterval` for deferred work | Job queue (Bull/BullMQ/Celery) | Processing that doesn't need to block the response |
| Full-text search via `LIKE '%term%'` | Search engine (Elasticsearch/Meilisearch) | Text search on >10K rows |
| Large file uploads stored in DB or local disk | Object storage (S3/MinIO) | Binary columns or `fs.writeFile` for user content |
| Analytics queries on production tables | Analytics DB (Snowflake/BigQuery/ClickHouse) | Aggregation queries mixed with OLTP |
| Multiple services sharing one DB | Event bus or API gateway | 2+ repos writing to same schema |
| No connection pooling | Connection pooler (PgBouncer) | Direct connections in serverless/high-concurrency |

**Do not flag something as missing unless the evidence is in the code.**

### Step 4: WRITE MANIFEST

Output the infrastructure manifest to `.planning/infra-manifest.md`:

```markdown
# Infrastructure Manifest

> Generated: {ISO date}
> Project: {project name from package.json or repo name}

## Current Systems

### {System Name} -- {Role}
- **Type**: {database|cache|queue|search|storage|auth|payments|...}
- **Product**: {PostgreSQL 15|Redis 7|Stripe SDK|...}
- **Config**: `{file path}`
- **Connection**: {method -- pooled, direct, SDK, ORM}
- **Used by**: {modules/services that import the client}

(repeat for each system)

## Connection Graph

{ASCII diagram of connections -- use /ascii-diagram conventions}

## Access Patterns

- {Pattern 1}: {evidence}
- {Pattern 2}: {evidence}

## Opportunities

### {Opportunity Title}
- **Signal**: {what in the code suggests this}
- **System**: {what would address it -- e.g., "Redis as cache layer"}
- **Impact**: {what improves -- latency, scalability, separation of concerns}
- **Effort**: low | medium | high

(repeat for each opportunity)

## Multi-Repo Considerations

{If the project references other repos, APIs, or shared databases, note them here.
This section feeds directly into /workspace if the user wants to act on opportunities
that span repos.}
```

### Step 5: RETURN

Present a summary to the user:
- How many systems found
- The connection graph (inline, not just in the file)
- Top opportunities ranked by signal strength
- Whether any opportunities would require multi-repo coordination (suggest `/workspace`)

## Fringe Cases

- **No docker-compose or env files**: Scan for hardcoded connection strings in source code.
  Many projects connect without formal config files. Check `src/`, `lib/`, `config/` for
  connection patterns. Note the absence of externalized config as a finding.
- **Monorepo with multiple services**: Treat each service directory as a separate scan target.
  Produce one manifest with sections per service. Note shared databases across services.
- **`.planning/` does not exist**: Create it before writing the manifest.
- **No infrastructure found**: Report that the project appears to be client-only or has no
  external dependencies. This is a valid finding, not an error.
- **Secrets in env files**: Never include actual secret values in the manifest. Record the
  variable name and which system it connects to, not the value.

## Contextual Gates

**Disclosure:** "Auditing infrastructure configuration. No files modified."
**Reversibility:** green — read-only audit; only writes `.planning/infra-manifest.md`; undo with `rm .planning/infra-manifest.md`.
**Trust gates:**
- Any: full audit, manifest generation, opportunity analysis.

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Every discovered system has: type, product, config path, connection method
- [ ] Connection graph covers all discovered systems
- [ ] Opportunities cite specific code evidence (file:line), not speculation
- [ ] No secret values appear in the manifest
- [ ] Manifest written to `.planning/infra-manifest.md`
- [ ] Multi-repo considerations section populated if cross-repo signals exist

## Exit Protocol

```
---HANDOFF---
- Scanned {N} config files, found {M} external systems
- Key systems: {list top 3-4}
- Top opportunity: {highest-signal opportunity}
- Multi-repo scope: {yes/no -- if yes, suggest /workspace}
- Reversibility: green — delete .planning/infra-manifest.md to undo
