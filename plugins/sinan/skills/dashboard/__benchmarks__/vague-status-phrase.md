## What This Tests

Users don't always say `/dashboard`. They say "what's going on", "what's happening",
"show me what's happening", etc. The `/do` router is supposed to catch these and
route to `/dashboard`.

This test verifies that a natural-language status question produces a dashboard,
not a confused response or an error.

## Expected Behavior

1. The skill recognizes the status-check intent
2. Routes to /dashboard behavior
3. Produces a complete dashboard output (same as explicit /dashboard call)
