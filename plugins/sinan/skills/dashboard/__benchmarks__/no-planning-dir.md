## What This Tests

A user who has just installed the harness but has not run `/do setup` yet.
The dashboard must render completely with empty/zero state and guide them
toward initialization — not crash or show raw Node.js error messages.

This is the most common first-run experience. Getting it wrong means the
user's first interaction with Sinan is a broken error dump.

## Expected Behavior

1. Dashboard renders the full template (all sections present)
2. All counts show 0 or "(none active)"
3. A visible hint to run `/do setup` appears
4. No raw file system errors leak into the output
