## What This Tests

A user mid-campaign who runs the dashboard to check project state.
The dashboard must surface the campaign name and phase without exposing
raw JSON entries from the telemetry files.

## Expected Behavior

1. Campaign "test-campaign" appears with phase progress (e.g., "Phase 2/3")
2. The direction or a truncated version appears
3. Recent activity shows the telemetry entries in human-readable form
4. No raw JSON objects appear in the output
