FAIL: Codex plugin mirror is out of sync with claude-plugin/skills/wiki-manager/.

The sync script has already regenerated plugins/zhi-codex/. To fix:
  1. git diff -- plugins/        # review the regenerated changes
  2. git add plugins/            # stage them alongside the Claude-side edit
  3. git commit                  # fold into the same commit
  4. ./tests/test-codex-sync.sh  # re-run to confirm clean

This guards against the Codex copy drifting from the Claude source.
