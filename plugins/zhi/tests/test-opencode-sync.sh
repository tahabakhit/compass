FAIL: OpenCode plugin mirror is out of sync with claude-plugin/skills/wiki-manager/.

The sync script has already regenerated plugins/zhi-opencode/. To fix:
  1. git diff -- plugins/zhi-opencode/   # review the regenerated changes
  2. git add plugins/zhi-opencode/        # stage them
  3. git commit                                # fold into the same commit
  4. ./tests/test-opencode-sync.sh             # re-run to confirm clean

This guards against the OpenCode copy drifting from the Claude source.
