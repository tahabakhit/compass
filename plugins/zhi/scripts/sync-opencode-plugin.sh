        "You manage an LLM-compiled knowledge base. Source documents are ingested into `raw/`, then incrementally compiled into a wiki of interconnected markdown articles. OpenCode is both the compiler and the query engine.\n\n## OpenCode Integration Notes\n\nThis skill is loaded as an instruction file. OpenCode does not have Claude-style `/wiki:*` slash commands or Codex-style `@wiki` invocations. Treat any `/wiki:*` references in this skill and its references as shorthand for the equivalent natural-language request. For example, `/wiki:compile` means the user is asking you to compile the wiki.\n\nOpenCode's built-in tools (`read`, `write`, `edit`, `glob`, `grep`, `bash`, `webfetch`, `websearch`) map directly to the tools this skill requires. Web search requires `OPENCODE_ENABLE_EXA=1` in the environment.\n\n**Permissions**: OpenCode sandboxes file access to the project directory. The wiki hub at `~/wiki/` is external. Add `external_directory` permissions in `opencode.json` to allow access: `{ \"permission\": { \"external_directory\": { \"~/wiki/**\": \"allow\", \"~/.config/llm-wiki/**\": \"allow\" } } }`. If your configured hub uses another absolute path (for example iCloud Drive), add that path too. Alternatively, use `--local` mode to keep everything in `.wiki/` inside the project.\n",
